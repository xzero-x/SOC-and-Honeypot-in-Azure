# SOC and Honeynet Implementation in Azure

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up a Security Operations Center (SOC) and deploying a Honeynet in Microsoft Azure. The goal is to create a secure environment to monitor, detect, and respond to security incidents while gathering valuable threat intelligence.

## Overview

- **SOC**: A centralized unit that deals with security issues on an organizational and technical level.
- **Honeynet**: A network of honeypots designed to attract and analyze malicious activity.

## Architecture Overview

1. **Virtual Network (VNet)**: A secure network environment in Azure where all components will reside.
2. **Honeypots**: Deceptive systems designed to lure attackers.
3. **SOC Tools**: Azure Sentinel, Log Analytics, and other security monitoring tools.
4. **Integration**: Connection of honeypots to the SOC for real-time monitoring and analysis.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Set Up a Virtual Network (VNet)

1. Navigate to the Azure Portal.
2. Create a new Virtual Network (VNet) in your desired region.
3. Define subnets within the VNet for different components (e.g., SOC, Honeynet).

### 2. Deploy Honeypots

1. **Create Virtual Machines**:
   - Deploy multiple VMs with different operating systems to serve as honeypots.
   - Ensure these VMs have minimal security hardening to appear vulnerable.

2. **Install Honeypot Software**:
   - Use open-source honeypot software like Cowrie, Dionaea, or Honeyd.
   - Configure each VM to mimic common services (e.g., SSH, HTTP) to attract attackers.

### 3. Set Up SOC Components

1. **Azure Sentinel**:
   - Enable Azure Sentinel in your Azure subscription.
   - Connect your Log Analytics workspace to Azure Sentinel for data ingestion.

2. **Log Analytics**:
   - Create a Log Analytics workspace.
   - Configure data sources to include logs from honeypots, Azure resources, and other security solutions.

3. **Configure Data Collection**:
   - Install the Log Analytics agent on your honeypot VMs.
   - Set up data connectors in Azure Sentinel to bring in relevant logs (e.g., network security groups, firewall logs).

### 4. Monitoring and Alerts

1. **Create Custom Alerts**:
   - Define alert rules in Azure Sentinel based on the log data from your honeypots.
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activity, such as unauthorized access attempts or unusual traffic patterns.

2. **Incident Response**:
   - Set up playbooks in Azure Sentinel for automated incident response.
   - Integrate with tools like Azure Logic Apps to automate responses, such as isolating a compromised VM.

### 5. Analysis and Threat Intelligence

1. **Honeypot Data Analysis**:
   - Regularly analyze the data collected from your honeypots to identify attack patterns and emerging threats.
   - Use Azure Sentinel's built-in machine learning models to detect anomalies.

2. **Threat Intelligence Sharing**:
   - Share insights gained from your honeynet with broader security communities.
   - Integrate with threat intelligence feeds in Azure Sentinel to enhance your SOC's detection capabilities.

## Best Practices

- Regularly update and patch your honeypot systems to avoid them becoming real threats.
- Keep your SOC components and logging infrastructure separate from production networks.
- Use Azure Security Center to monitor the overall security posture of your Azure environment.
